The **"Movie Deck"** web page is a dynamic and user-friendly platform that leverages the power of the movieDB API to display a curated list of top-rated movies. The page features an intuitive interface with a header, search bar, sorting options, tabs, movie list pagination, and a footer.

The header includes a link with the heading "Movie Deck" to navigate back to the home page. The search bar enables users to find movies by name, and the autocomplete attribute enhances the user experience. Sorting options allow users to arrange movies by date or rating, providing flexibility in exploration.

Tabs offer the choice between viewing all movies and favorites, with the active tab visually indicated. Each movie card in the list showcases essential details, such as the movie poster, title, vote count, vote average, and a favorite icon for user interaction. Font Awesome icons enhance the favorite button.

The pagination feature facilitates seamless navigation through different pages of movies, with buttons for "Previous," "Current Page," and "Next." The previous button is disabled on the initial page, and the next button is disabled on the last page, ensuring a smooth browsing experience.

To enhance the aesthetic appeal, the CSS styling incorporates colors, fonts, borders, margins, paddings, and Flexbox for optimal layout. Box-sizing, border-radius, cursor, and placeholder properties are employed to customize element appearance and behavior.

The JavaScript functionality fetches movie data from the movieDB API, rendering titles, vote counts, vote averages, and poster images in cards. Users can sort movies based on release date and ratings in both ascending and descending order. The search functionality enables users to find movies by name, and favorites can be added or removed, with data stored in local storage for persistence across page refreshes.

Incorporating a Favourites tab, pagination, and a copyright notice in the footer, the Movie Deck web page offers a seamless and engaging experience for movie enthusiasts, combining API integration, dynamic sorting, search capabilities, and user-friendly design.
